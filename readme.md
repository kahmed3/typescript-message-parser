To convert or enhance into a full Web Application or an API. I will use the following frameworks/packages and methods:

- Mongoose as an ORM for a database MongoDB
- A different ORM for a RDBMs like MySQL
- dotenv: Maintain a separate configuation file to hold secrets and environment variables
- Define a logger like Winston or a custom built logger
